<h1>These are my journal entries!</h1>
<h2>Journal Entry #1</h2>
<h3>I have learned most of the basics of HTML's. I am beginning to work on my website, yet I don't know how to fully complete my vision yet. I have created the two basketball hoops, and made it so that when each hoop is clicked, it takes the viewer to either the projects or journals page. My desired effect would be for there to be a ball and the viewer would have to make a basket in one of the hoops, and that is how they would access the page they are trying to see. This would add a fun element to the starting page and work almost as a hook to get the viewer invested in my website and want to learn more. </h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #2</h2>
<h3>Adding to github</h3>
<h4>cd ./desktop/carco35.github.io<br>
git add .<br>
git commit -m "adding things"<br>
git push</h4>
<h2>Journal Entry #3</h2>
<h3>I played with using alerts and console log on a page in my browser. It is really cool. I deciding to create a scavenger hunt in which the viewer will look in the console log to get clues as to how to reach the final page. These clues will be a series of tasks such as, "click the bottom right corner", in order to switch to other pages. The final page will contain two of my projects for the viewer to play with. </h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #4</h2>
<h3>I have finished the scavenger hunt, and it came out really well. I also finished a jumpscare that is quite frightening. I put a lot of work into these two projects,and I am pleased with the finished product. Now I'm working on linking all of my projects on the projects page, and then pushing my website, so that everyone can access my projects.</h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #5</h2>
<h3>I just finished and published my nba project. It shows the Celtics saying that they will win the championship, but when you click, it shows that the Knicks are actually going to win. I had fun making that project. I now have a decent amounts of projects that are on my projects page, and that page has been pushed. </h3

<h2>Journal Entry #6</h2>
<h3>A function is an action, you can put things inside of it. When you "call it" or "run it" it does the things inside of it. You can define and specify what your function does so that it does specific things (like changing the specific traits or characteristics of an element on the page). Sometimes when we want to run a function on the whole document we say document.____... When we want to do this with a div we say it's id then it's style and then the atribute to change - we usually put these things inside themselves (e.g. box.style.opacity = "0").</h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #7</h2>
<h3>I made a project that randomly changes the color of a circle as it moves randomly across the screen. It is really cool. I learned how to use the Math.random command which can spice up projects in the future.</h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #8</h2>
<h3>I made a project that allows for a lightswitch concept. I will expand it, yet as of right now, when you click on the blue square, it changes to a cool and niche color called blanched almond. Eventually, I plan to make it stop and start a song, and maybe even switch songs. Possibly, I can make it do other cool things such as make the square move, disappeer, split in half, increase in size, or whatever else I manage to think of.</h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #9</h2>
<h3>Today we went over the CSS quiz and explained many points of confusion. I learned a lot. I fortified my knowledge about arrays, variables, and animations. Additionally, I tested myself by seeing how many html elements and commands I could name. By learning what I knew and adding to that, I drastically increased my capabilities in coding and creating projects. This process also gave me ideas for possible projects that I could make in the future. Overall, this experience helped a lot and really furthered myself as a coder and innovator.</h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #10</h2>
<h3>I am really happy with my website right now. I just finished making a basketball that is the mouse on the page, and when I click it falls as if its a shot on the basketball hoop. Eventually, I want to have the ball have something to do with entering the pages of the website. Maybe I will also make some kind of game out of it. I made the ball work like it does by giving it the same coordinates as the mouse and making an event listener so that when I click it falls down with a transition that makes it look like a shot on the hoop. Overall, I am happy where I am right now and I'm excited to continue.</h3>
