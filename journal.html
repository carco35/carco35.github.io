<h1>These are my journal entries!</h1>
<h2>Journal Entry #1</h2>
<h3>I have learned most of the basics of HTML's. I am beginning to work on my website, yet I don't know how to fully complete my vision yet. I have created the two basketball hoops, and made it so that when each hoop is clicked, it takes the viewer to either the projects or journals page. My desired effect would be for there to be a ball and the viewer would have to make a basket in one of the hoops, and that is how they would access the page they are trying to see. This would add a fun element to the starting page and work almost as a hook to get the viewer invested in my website and want to learn more. </h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #2</h2>
<h3>Adding to github</h3>
<h4>cd ./desktop/carco35.github.io<br>
git add .<br>
git commit -m "adding things"<br>
git push</h4>
<h2>Journal Entry #3</h2>
<h3>I played with using alerts and console log on a page in my browser. It is really cool. I deciding to create a scavenger hunt in which the viewer will look in the console log to get clues as to how to reach the final page. These clues will be a series of tasks such as, "click the bottom right corner", in order to switch to other pages. The final page will contain two of my projects for the viewer to play with. </h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #4</h2>
<h3>I have finished the scavenger hunt, and it came out really well. I also finished a jumpscare that is quite frightening. I put a lot of work into these two projects,and I am pleased with the finished product. Now I'm working on linking all of my projects on the projects page, and then pushing my website, so that everyone can access my projects.</h3>
