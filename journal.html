<h1>These are my journal entries!</h1>
<h2>Journal Entry #1</h2>
<h3>I have learned most of the basics of HTML's. I am beginning to work on my website, yet I don't know how to fully complete my vision yet. I have created the two basketball hoops, and made it so that when each hoop is clicked, it takes the viewer to either the projects or journals page. My desired effect would be for there to be a ball and the viewer would have to make a basket in one of the hoops, and that is how they would access the page they are trying to see. This would add a fun element to the starting page and work almost as a hook to get the viewer invested in my website and want to learn more. </h3>
